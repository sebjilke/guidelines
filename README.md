# Experimental Reporting Guidelines for Experiments in Public Management, a Checklist

>[James, O., Jilke, S. &amp; G. Van Ryzin. 2017. *Experiments in Public Management Research: Challenges and Contributions*. Cambrige: Cambridge University Press](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/experiments-in-public-management-research/8DB826A84D228568AAEC69732C72F1EC) (pages 509-511).

Below are a series of questions and recomemended issues that experimental researchers in public administration and management may want to address when reporting their experimental studies.  The checklist is drawn from James, Jilke and Van Ryzin (2017), but synthesizes and extends reporting guidelines for experiments from the social and medical sciences.<sup>1</sup>

### 1. Hypotheses and theories they are drawn from
#### a. Specific objectives and hypotheses
i. *What questions was the experiment designed to address?*<br/>
ii. *What specific hypotheses were tested? (e.g., the causal factor extimated, the expected sign and magnitude of expect effects on outcomes, and whther expected effects are expected to be homogenous or to var by subgroups.)*


### 2. Methods
#### a. Subject recruitment
i. *What was the exact setting and location of data collecton? (e.g., a laboratory room at a university, online survey)*<br/>
ii. *Recruitment date(s)? (including follow-ups)*</br>
iii. *Any eligibility or exclusion criteria for subjects?*</br>
iv. *How (and by whom) were oarticipants recuited and selected? (e.g., recruitment by researchers,s urvey recruitment firm)*</br>
v. *Response rate (if applicable)?*

#### b. Design
i. *Specific experiemntal design? (e.g., parallel, factorial, conjoint, within or between subjects)*

#### c. Treatments
i. *Is there a detailed description of treatments? (e.g., provide all materials in main text or an appendix or supporting documents.)*<br/>
ii. *Was a control and/or placebo group used?*<br/>
iii. *Which method of treatment delivery was used? (e.g., pen-and-paper, computer, smartphone, face-to-face, telephone)*

#### d. Randomization
i. *Which method and software were used to generate the randomization sequence?*<br/>
ii. *What type of randomization was used? (e.g., clustered, blocked assignment)*<br/>
iii. *What was the unit of randomization? (individuals, households, organisations)* <br/>
iv. *Were participants, those administering the manipulations, and those assessing the outcomes unaware of condition assignment (i.e., blinding)?*<br/>
v. *Was the allocaton process followed correctly? (e.g., substantial imbalances of characteristics of across groups can play a role in revealing failures of implementation)*

#### e. Outcomes
i.

#### f. Sample size
i.


### 3. Results

### 4. Other information
